## Key Insights

### Best Practices from Anthropic

> "Telling Claude to use subagents to verify details or investigate particular questions it might have, especially early on in a conversation or task, tends to preserve context availability without much downside in terms of lost efficiency."

> Use thinking triggers: "think" < "think hard" < "think harder" < "ultrathink"

### Subagent Characteristics

- **Isolated Context**: Each subagent operates in its own context window
- **Automatic Invocation**: Based on task context
- **Specialized Instructions**: Tailored to their expertise
- **Parallel Execution**: Up to 10 agents simultaneously
