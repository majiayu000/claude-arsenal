# Competitive Analysis

## Competitive Analysis Frameworks

### Types of Competitors

```markdown

Example: Slack vs Microsoft Teams vs Discord (for work)

## Indirect Competitors
Different solution, same problem
Example: Email vs project management tools (both for team communication)

## Substitute Products
Solves problem in fundamentally different way
Example: Uber vs public transit vs bike sharing

## Potential Entrants
Not competing today, but could enter your market
Example: Apple entering search (potential threat to Google)
```

## Concept
Instead of competing in existing markets (red oceans),
create new market space (blue oceans)

## Framework: Value Innovation
Simultaneously pursue differentiation AND low cost

## Four Actions Framework

### Eliminate
What factors the industry takes for granted should be eliminated?
Example: Cirque du Soleil eliminated animals (expensive, controversial)

### Reduce
What factors should be reduced well below industry standard?
Example: Southwest eliminated seat selection, meals

### Raise
What factors should be raised well above industry standard?
Example: Cirque raised artistic production value

### Create
What factors should be created that industry never offered?
Example: Cirque created theme-based shows (vs traditional circus)

## Application to Product

### Example: Video Conferencing (Zoom)

Eliminate:
- Complex setup and configuration
- Need for IT support
- Expensive hardware

Reduce:
- Meeting room requirements
- Training time

Raise:
- Video quality
- Reliability (fewer dropped calls)

- "What impressed you most about [our product]?"
- "What concerned you about [our product]?"
- "How did [competitor] compare?"

## Battlecards for Sales

### Purpose

```markdown
Equip sales team to compete effectively

Battlecards provide:
- Quick reference on competitor
- Our advantages vs theirs
- How to position against them
- Objection handling
```

### Battlecard Template

```markdown
# Battlecard: Competitor A

## Overview
**What they do:** Project management for teams
**Target market:** SMB to mid-market
**Pricing:** $15/user/month
**Strengths:** Easy to use, many integrations, strong brand
**Weaknesses:** Lacks advanced features, limited customization

---

## Our Advantages

### 1. AI-Powered Insights ✓
**Us:** Built-in AI suggests priorities, predicts delays
**Them:** No AI capabilities
**Message:** "We help you work smarter, not just organize tasks"

### 2. Advanced Customization ✓
**Us:** Custom fields, workflows, automations
**Them:** Limited to pre-built templates
**Message:** "Adapt the tool to your process, not vice versa"

### 3. Superior Reporting ✓
**Us:** Real-time dashboards, custom reports, exports
**Them:** Basic reports only
**Message:** "Visibility for stakeholders, not just task tracking"

---

## Their Advantages (How to Counter)

### 1. More Integrations (100+ vs our 20)
**Counter:** "We focus on deep integrations that matter (Slack, Salesforce, GitHub).
Our API lets you build any integration you need.
What integrations are must-haves for you?"

### 2. Lower Price ($15/user vs our $25/user)
**Counter:** "Our AI saves managers 5+ hours/week. At $50/hour salary, that's $250/week saved.
ROI pays for itself in days."

### 3. Bigger Brand
**Counter:** "True, they're well-known. But ask their users about [AI features, customization].
We're newer, which means we're building with modern tech and your needs in mind."

---

## Common Objections

### "We're already using Competitor A"
**Response:**
"That's great — they're a solid tool. What prompted you to look at alternatives?"
[Listen for pain points]
"We hear that a lot from customers who switched. The top reasons they moved to us were:
1) AI saves hours per week, 2) Advanced reporting for stakeholders, 3) Better ROI despite higher price.
Can I show you how [specific feature] would work for [their use case]?"

### "Competitor A has more integrations"
**Response:**
"Good point. Which integrations are critical for you?"
[Focus on integrations you HAVE]
"We support those! We prioritize deep, reliable integrations over long lists.
Plus, our API is robust — [Customer X] built their custom integration in a day."

---

## When to Position Against Them
- Deals with >50 users (our sweet spot)
- Teams that need customization
- Companies with technical resources (API integration)

## When NOT to Position
- Tiny teams (<10 users) → They'll choose cheaper option
- Non-technical users → Simplicity wins
- Companies with no budget → Not worth discount battle
```
