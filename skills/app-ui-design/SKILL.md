# Mobile App UI Design

> Expert guidance for designing beautiful, accessible, and platform-native mobile app interfaces following 2025 best practices.

## Core Philosophy

- **User-First Design** — Prioritize user needs, behaviors, and mental models over aesthetics
- **Platform Consistency** — Follow iOS HIG and Android Material Design guidelines
- **Accessibility as Foundation** — Design for all users from the start, not as an afterthought
- **Emotional Intelligence** — Create interfaces that users emotionally connect with
- **Performance-Conscious** — Beautiful design that doesn't sacrifice app performance

---

## Hard Rules (Must Follow)

> These rules are mandatory. Violating them means the skill is not working correctly.

### Accessibility First

**All designs must meet WCAG 2.2 AA standards. Accessibility is not optional.**

```markdown
❌ FORBIDDEN:
- Color contrast below 4.5:1 for text
- Touch targets smaller than 44×44pt (iOS) or 48×48dp (Android)
- Information conveyed by color alone
- Missing alternative text for images
- Non-keyboard-navigable interfaces

✅ REQUIRED:
- Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text
- Minimum 3:1 contrast ratio for large text (18pt+)
- Touch targets: 44×44pt (iOS) / 48×48dp (Android)
- Support for Dynamic Type / Font Scaling
- VoiceOver (iOS) / TalkBack (Android) compatibility
- Clear focus indicators for keyboard navigation
```

### Platform Guidelines Adherence

**Follow platform-specific design guidelines. Do not mix iOS and Android patterns.**

```markdown
❌ FORBIDDEN:
- Using Android-style FAB on iOS
- Using iOS-style bottom sheets on Android without adaptation
- Mixing platform navigation patterns
- Ignoring platform typography (SF Pro vs Roboto)

✅ REQUIRED:
iOS (Human Interface Guidelines):
- Use SF Pro font family
- Tab bar at bottom for primary navigation
- Push navigation with back chevron
- Standard iOS controls (UIKit/SwiftUI)

Android (Material Design 3):
- Use Roboto font family
- Bottom navigation bar or navigation drawer
- Material components with ripple effects
- Follow Material You dynamic theming
```

### Consistent Design System

**Every app must have a documented design system with tokens.**

```markdown
❌ FORBIDDEN:
- Ad-hoc colors and spacing values
- Inconsistent button styles across screens
- Multiple unnamed font sizes
- Components without defined states

✅ REQUIRED:
Design System Must Include:
├── Color Tokens (primary, secondary, surface, error, etc.)
├── Typography Scale (heading1-6, body, caption, etc.)
├── Spacing Scale (4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48px)
├── Border Radius Tokens (none, sm, md, lg, full)
├── Shadow/Elevation Tokens (elevation1-5)
└── Component Library (button, input, card, etc.)
```

### Touch-Friendly Design

**All interactive elements must be optimized for touch interaction.**

```markdown
❌ FORBIDDEN:
- Touch targets smaller than minimum size
- Interactive elements too close together (<8px gap)
- Important actions outside thumb reach zone
- Hover-dependent interactions

✅ REQUIRED:
- Minimum touch target: 44×44pt (iOS) / 48×48dp (Android)
- Minimum spacing between targets: 8px
- Primary actions in thumb-friendly zone (bottom 2/3)
- Clear tap feedback (ripple, highlight, scale)
```

## Design System Fundamentals

### Color System

```markdown
## Color Token Structure

### Semantic Colors
primary          → Main brand color, CTAs
primary-variant  → Darker/lighter primary for states
secondary        → Secondary actions, accents
background       → App background
surface          → Card backgrounds, elevated surfaces
error            → Error states, destructive actions
on-primary       → Text/icons on primary color
on-background    → Text/icons on background
on-surface       → Text/icons on surface

### Color Palette (60-30-10 Rule)
60% → Neutral/background colors
30% → Secondary/supporting colors
10% → Accent/primary colors

### Dark Mode Considerations
- Don't just invert colors
- Use desaturated colors for dark surfaces
- Reduce contrast slightly (avoid pure white on black)
- Maintain color meaning across modes
```

### Typography Scale

```markdown
## Mobile Typography Guidelines

### iOS Typography (SF Pro)
Large Title   → 34pt, Bold
Title 1       → 28pt, Bold
Title 2       → 22pt, Bold
Title 3       → 20pt, Semibold
Headline      → 17pt, Semibold
Body          → 17pt, Regular
Callout       → 16pt, Regular
Subhead       → 15pt, Regular
Footnote      → 13pt, Regular
Caption 1     → 12pt, Regular
Caption 2     → 11pt, Regular

### Android Typography (Roboto / Material 3)
Display Large  → 57sp
Display Medium → 45sp
Display Small  → 36sp
Headline Large → 32sp
Headline Medium→ 28sp
Headline Small → 24sp
Title Large    → 22sp
Title Medium   → 16sp, Medium
Title Small    → 14sp, Medium
Body Large     → 16sp
Body Medium    → 14sp
Body Small     → 12sp
Label Large    → 14sp, Medium
Label Medium   → 12sp, Medium
Label Small    → 11sp, Medium

### Best Practices
- Maximum 2-3 font families per app
- Minimum body text: 16px (14px absolute minimum)
- Line height: 1.4-1.6× font size for body text
- Support Dynamic Type (iOS) / Font Scaling (Android)
```

### Spacing System

```markdown
## 8-Point Grid System

Base Unit: 8px

### Spacing Scale
spacing-0    → 0px
spacing-1    → 4px   (half unit)
spacing-2    → 8px   (1 unit)
spacing-3    → 12px  (1.5 units)
spacing-4    → 16px  (2 units)
spacing-5    → 24px  (3 units)
spacing-6    → 32px  (4 units)
spacing-7    → 48px  (6 units)
spacing-8    → 64px  (8 units)

### Component Spacing
Button padding      → 12px vertical, 24px horizontal
Card padding        → 16px
List item padding   → 16px horizontal, 12px vertical
Section spacing     → 24px-32px
Screen edge margin  → 16px (phones), 24px (tablets)

### Touch Target Spacing
Minimum gap between interactive elements: 8px
Recommended gap: 12-16px
```

## Platform Guidelines

### iOS Human Interface Guidelines

```markdown
## iOS Design Principles

### Core Principles
1. Clarity    → Text legible, icons precise, purpose obvious
2. Deference  → UI helps understanding, not competing with content
3. Depth      → Visual layers and realistic motion convey hierarchy

### Navigation Patterns
- Tab Bar (bottom) → 3-5 primary destinations
- Navigation Bar (top) → Title, back button, actions
- Modal sheets → Temporary focused tasks
- Popovers (iPad) → Contextual options

### 2025 Updates: Liquid Glass
- Translucent materials for controls
- Floating navigation elements
- Dynamic depth and hierarchy
- Background blur effects

### Safe Areas
- Top: Status bar + Dynamic Island/Notch
- Bottom: Home indicator (34pt on Face ID devices)
- Use safeAreaInsets for proper content placement

### Standard Dimensions
- Navigation bar height: 44pt (96pt with large title)
- Tab bar height: 49pt (83pt on Face ID devices)
- Toolbar height: 44pt
```

### Android Material Design 3

```markdown
## Material Design 3 Principles

### Core Concepts
1. Material You    → Personal, adaptive, dynamic color
2. Expressiveness  → Emotional connection through design
3. Accessibility   → Inclusive design for all users

### Navigation Patterns
- Bottom Navigation → 3-5 primary destinations
- Navigation Drawer → 5+ destinations or secondary nav
- Navigation Rail → Tablets and large screens
- Top App Bar → Title, navigation, actions

### Material 3 Expressive (2025)
- Dynamic color from user wallpaper
- Springy, physics-based motion
- Bolder, more expressive typography
- Rounded, approachable shapes

### Component Shapes
- Extra Small: 4dp
- Small: 8dp
- Medium: 12dp
- Large: 16dp
- Extra Large: 28dp
- Full: 50% (pills/circles)

### Standard Dimensions
- App bar height: 64dp
- Bottom navigation height: 80dp
- FAB size: 56dp (standard), 40dp (small), 96dp (large)
```

## 2025 Design Trends

### AI-Driven Personalization

```markdown
## Adaptive UI Patterns

### Personalization Strategies
- Content recommendations based on behavior
- Adaptive UI layouts based on usage patterns
- Smart defaults and predictive actions
- Contextual feature suggestions

### Implementation Guidelines
- Always provide manual override options
- Explain why content is recommended
- Respect user privacy preferences
- Gradual personalization (don't overwhelm new users)
```

### Dark Mode Excellence

```markdown
## Dark Mode Best Practices

### Color Adaptation
Light Mode          →    Dark Mode
White (#FFFFFF)     →    Dark gray (#121212)
Black (#000000)     →    White (#FFFFFF)
Primary (vibrant)   →    Primary (desaturated)
Shadows             →    Subtle shadows or none

### Surface Elevation (Material 3)
Elevation 0  → #121212
Elevation 1  → #1E1E1E (+ 5% white overlay)
Elevation 2  → #232323 (+ 7% white overlay)
Elevation 3  → #272727 (+ 8% white overlay)
Elevation 4  → #2C2C2C (+ 9% white overlay)
Elevation 5  → #323232 (+ 11% white overlay)

### Recommendations
- Auto-switch based on system setting
- Separate color tokens for light/dark
- Test contrast in both modes
- Consider OLED optimization (true blacks)
```

### Microinteractions

```markdown
## Meaningful Motion

### Types of Microinteractions
- Feedback → Button press, form submission
- State → Loading, success, error
- Guidance → Onboarding hints, tooltips
- Delight → Celebration animations, easter eggs

### Motion Principles
- Duration: 200-500ms for most interactions
- Easing: Use natural easing curves
- Purpose: Every animation should have a reason
- Performance: Use hardware-accelerated properties

### 2025 Trends
- Springy, physics-based animations
- Morphing transitions between states
- Gesture-driven interactions
- Reduced motion support for accessibility
```

### Glassmorphism & Neumorphism

```markdown
## Modern Visual Styles

### Glassmorphism
Properties:
- Background blur (backdrop-filter: blur)
- Transparency (10-40% opacity)
- Subtle border (1px white at 20% opacity)
- Soft shadow

Use Cases:
- Overlays and modals
- Cards on image backgrounds
- Navigation bars (iOS Liquid Glass)

Caution:
- Ensure text readability
- Consider performance impact
- Provide fallback for older devices

### Neumorphism (Soft UI)
Properties:
- Soft shadows (light and dark)
- Subtle elevation effect
- Muted color palette

Use Cases:
- Toggle switches
- Input fields
- Cards

Caution:
- Often fails accessibility contrast tests
- Use sparingly, not as primary style
- Always test with actual content
```
